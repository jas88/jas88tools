watchwc - wc replacement with continuous updates

Unix platforms commonly provide a tool called 'watch' which will periodically
execute a command, allowing you to monitor the output over a period of time,
along with 'wc' for performing word, character and line counts.

One day, I found myself counting files in a directory. Easy enough:

find . -type f | wc -l

Each filename is shown on a line of its own - provided you have no embedded
newlines in your filenames, which would be evil - then wc -l counts those
lines.

The one drawback is that I was running this command on a busy disk, so
counting the 16,693 files in 7,344 directories took quite a while - with
no visible feedback until the final answer appeared.

Enter watchwc. The same four command line switches, the same output - but
updated as it goes, so the number on screen will count up to the final result
rather than keep you waiting.
