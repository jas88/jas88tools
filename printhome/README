A simple Apple OS X launchd.plist file which instructs launchd to launch an
ssh tunnel to port 631 of your home system whenever port 1631 on localhost
is used. Handy for printing to home from remote locations - but, usefully,
also works fine from home, so no need to change configuration when you come
and go!

Just change the two bracketed parts (the unique print ID and your home
username/hostname) and drop it into ~/Library/LaunchAgents, then you
can print away to 127.0.0.1:1631 wherever you are, as long as you can
SSH home.

Also works for a lightweight 'VPN' to access hosts behind an SSH-capable
firewall - change the 127.0.0.1:631 to the port you want to reach. For example,
to reach SSH on 192.168.1.100, put 192.168.1.100:22 and change 1631 to 8022,
then:

ssh -p 8022 username@127.0.0.1

Personally, I use this for printing to home from away, as well as SSHing to
an internal system via an externally-reachable one. Plenty more possibilities
exist.
