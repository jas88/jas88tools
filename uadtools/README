This collection of scripts was originally created in 2016 to automate
maintenance of the University of Abertay Dundee's three specialist
computer labs. While some effort is made to make the scripts versatile,
your environment will probably require some customisation.

Lab setup:

All labs are in RFC1918 space, with NATted access to the outside world.

Labs 2022 (Digital Forensics) and 4510 (Networking) share 10.1.0/21.
Lab 4511 (Ethical Hacking) is on 10.0.0.0/21, with no connection to the others.
Each lab has a server on 0.3 in the appropriate subnet as DHCP server.

2022 and 4510 machines can be distinguised by IP address:
2022 uses 10.1.5.1xx
4510 stops at 10.1.5.20-99


Partitions:
Each client machine has a single 1Tb SATA hard drive, partitioned into 4:
sda1 - 100Gb Windows 7 image (NTFS)
sda2 -  50Gb Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) image (ext4)
sda3 -  32Gb Linux swap partition
sda4 - remaining space as shared data drive (NTFS, D: on Windows)

Booting:
All systems boot from the server via PXE and present a menu with four options:
1. Windows 7
2. Ubuntu
3. TinyCore (network booted, used for administration)
4. Reimage

The final option, reimage, repartitions, reformats and reimages the PC without
further user intervention. This is triggered automatically every night, and can
also be triggered manually to recover a corrupted machine or ensure a known
baseline for forensic work.

Rather than plain PXE (DHCP+TFTP), PXELinux's HTTP support is used to load
most of the boot time resources over HTTP from the server running nginx.
This means the file transfer is mostly done over TCP rather than UDP, and 

Status updates:
The script status.pl can be run from cron and products an HTML status page
indicating how long ago each PC was last booted and what mode it entered.
