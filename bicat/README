bicat - Bidirectional socket connector

(c) James A Sutherland 2013

Usage:
	bicat (switches)
	-a	Local IP address to listen on, default 0.0.0.0 (all addresses)
	-b	Buffer size in bytes, default 4kb, maximum 16Mb
	-p	Port number to listen on, default 443
	-r	Remote port number to connect to, default 443
	-s	Remote IP address to connect to

The -s switch, specifying what address to connect to, is required; all others
optional.


Example:
	bicat -s ssl.example.com
	
	Any HTTPS request (port 443) to local IP addresses will then be forwarded
	to 'ssl.example.com'. (If that server uses name-based virtual hosts, this
	may not have the expected results.)
