atee - asynchronous tee variant
(c) James A Sutherland 2016

Functionality:
	Read all input from a pipe into a local file, also piping that data to stdout.
	Unlike conventional tee, do not allow the output process to block input.

Original use case:
	Distributing a compressed filesystem image via multicast, both saving and
	unpacking to disk in the process.
	
	udp-receiver ... | atee /data/image.txz | xz -d | tar xf -
	
	Conventional tee was not ideal for this: both xz and tar can block.
	The udp-receiver will then get blocked waiting to write, causing it to drop
	incoming multicast packets and slowing the entire transfer session.
	
	Using atee instead of tee means the transfer is buffered to disk as fast as
	possible, allowing the multicast session to proceed independently of unpacking.
