Simple line-counting progress monitor

Usage: lineprog n

Counts incoming lines, printing the percentage. This is intended to give a progress
indicator for tools like tar, probably to pipe to a tool like dialog:

(tar cvf - . > /tmp/tar.tar) 2>&1 | ./lineprog `find .|wc -l` | dialog --gauge "Archiving data" 10 70 0
